I faced a couple of problems related to the way data had been gathered. They included a date, but the formatting make it impossible to make any kind of comparisons or aggregation per year or month. I solved that adding two extra columns (Year and Month) with Excel.

Another issue was trying to draw a stacked bar graph that would allow me to display the average proportion of men vs. women in shelters (men are usually three in four individuals using these services). After navigating different paths, I was not able to get the desired output.
